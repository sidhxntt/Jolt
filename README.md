A **Scaffolding CLI tool** to accelerate the development process and enhance the developer experience with streamlined workflows, automated project setup, and best-practice templates. ðŸš€

The name **"Praxis"** is a strong fit for your scaffolding CLI tool because:

1. **Practical Application of Theory**:  
   "Praxis" refers to the process of putting **theory into practice**â€”which aligns perfectly with your toolâ€™s mission to **transform abstract development concepts into working code**. Your CLI bridges the gap between best practices and real-world implementation.

2. **Efficiency & Action**:  
   The word implies **action-oriented** workflowsâ€”just like your CLI accelerates development by **automating repetitive tasks** and providing ready-to-use templates.

3. **Philosophical Depth**:  
   In philosophy, **praxis** describes the cycle of **reflection and action** to improve processesâ€”mirroring how your tool encourages **iterative development** and **best practices**.

4. **Developer-Centric**:  
   Your tool isnâ€™t just about generating codeâ€”it enhances the **developer experience** by providing a **thoughtful, structured** foundation. "Praxis" reflects this focus on **intentional, high-quality** software creation.

5. **Memorable & Unique**:  
   "Praxis" is a **short, punchy**, and **distinctive** name that is easy to remember, helping it stand out in the crowded ecosystem of dev tools.
